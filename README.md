# Docsy Docker Image

![build status](https://github.com/leizhilong/docsy-docker/workflows/docker-publish/badge.svg)

This docker image is based on [hugo-docker](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-docker) but cached docsy theme and its dependencies inside. An entrypoint shell is also included to pre-run copying the theme  into working directory.
